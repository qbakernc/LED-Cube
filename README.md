# LED-Cube
5x5x5 LED Cube Matrix that displays animations. The cube was designed, assembled, and programmed by me. Assembly Language was used to program the cube.

What I learned
* Learned the concept of Binary Code Modulation to adjust LED brightness.
* Learned the concept of LED Multiplexing.
* Increased code organization skills.
* Increased my knowledge on reusable functions.
